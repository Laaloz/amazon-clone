**Version 1.0.0**

This app is FAKE amazon  **test-work**. You can create an account and it will save it to firebase database. After created an account you can log-in and out. There is fully working shop place where you can add or remove items and app uses [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/en-fi) for card data to buy items "do not buy!"

## Features

* The application was made with [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* The application runs on the latest Chrome version

### Styles

I used SCSS [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and SCSS [Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) to make view more responsive

### Details

Add items to basket, when adding into basket you can remove item or continue to checkout. Checkout page will show you items subtotal and price. After choosing items you can continue and proceed items and add card information
